<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and curious programmer with a strong interest
   in solving real-world problems through code. With a foundation 
   in languages like C, C++, and Python, I enjoy building efficient
    algorithms and exploring the inner workings of how things function 
    behind the scenes. Whether it's designing clean, structured solutions
     or debugging tricky issues, Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve.</p>

<p>Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science, I have worked
   on small-scale projects ranging from simple web pages using HTML/CSS
    to logic-heavy programs in C and C++. I actively explore new technologies
     and have a growing interest in fields like data structures, software 
     development, and web technologies. I believe that consistent practice,
      curiosity, and collaboration are key to becoming a better developer..</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I enjoy learning from open-source communities, reading tech
   blogs, and participating in programming challenges. My goal is to build solutions
    that make an impact while continuously evolving as a developer.</p>
